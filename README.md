# Hobby OS
> osdev as a hobby, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

## Get Started
### Install Prerequisite Packages
#### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev zlib1g-dev texinfo libexpat-dev
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86
```
#### Mac
```
brew install gmp mpfr libmpc texinfo
brew install qemu
```

### Setup Toolchain
```
scripts/install_binutils.sh
scripts/install_gcc.sh
scripts/install_gdb.sh
```
#### Configure PATH
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/cross/bin
```

### Install Grub2 Tools
Our OS leverage GRUB2 as boot loader, so we need to use the grub2 tools to pack our disk image.
ðŸ’¡ It is not recommended to mess with boot loader on your working machine. You should be very careful when working with
GRUB and make sure it apply on a disk image only.

#### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install grub2-common grub-pc-bin xorriso
```
#### Mac
GRUB2 is not supported on mac, to use the grub tools, one way is to use docker run the grub tools:
```
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --name osdev \
  -v "$PWD:/mnt/data" \
  ubuntu:22.04 \
  bash -c "apt-get update \
           && apt-get install -y grub2-common grub-pc-bin xorriso \
           && grub-mkrescue -o /mnt/data/myos.iso /mnt/data/iso"
```
> Makefile will launch similar docker command on mac when building image.
